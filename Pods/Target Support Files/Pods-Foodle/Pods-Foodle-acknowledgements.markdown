      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE AGREEMENT.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL NEXMO OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, 
BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
OF ANY KIND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF 
SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY OR RIGHTS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION, OR OTHER DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (US$100), EVEN IF AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. BASIS OF BARGAIN.  YOU AND NEXMO EACH RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS
IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR BASES FOR THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED
IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT.

9. TERMINATION.  You may terminate this Agreement and the license granted by Nexmo to you herein at any time.  Nexmo may 
terminate this Agreement and the licenses granted by Nexmo to you in this Agreement immediately if you breach any provision of 
this Agreement, in additional to all other available remedies.  Upon termination, all of your rights and licenses from Nexmo 
under this Agreement cease; you must cease exercise of the licensed rights herein; you must destroy or remove from all hard 
drives, networks, and storage media, all copies and extracts of the SDK; and this sentence, all remedies for breach, and 
Sections 2 through 8 and 10 through 13 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TERMINATION OF 
YOUR RIGHTS TO THE SDK MAY CAUSE YOUR PRODUCT(S) TO NOT OPERATE PROPERLY, AND NEXMO WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY 
WHATSOEVER AS A RESULT THEREOF.

10. FREEDOM TO OPERATE.  You agree that Nexmo may collect or you may provide to Nexmo (or publicly)  comments, feedback, 
suggestions or other information related to the SDK, or modifications, corrections, improvements, derivatives and extensions
to the SDK, or use thereof (collectively, “Feedback”), and you hereby grant Nexmo the perpetual and irrevocable right (and the
perpetual and irrevocable right to permit others) to use and fully exercise and exploit the Feedback in any manner to improve, 
develop and otherwise exploit applications, services or technology, and otherwise in connection with its business during and 
after the term of this Agreement.

11. EXPORT.  You shall comply with all laws, rules and regulations of the Department of Commerce, the United States Department 
of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and other United States or foreign agency or authority, and not 
export, or allow the export or re-export of the SDK in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations.  By downloading
or using the SDK or exercising any of the rights granted in this Agreement, you are agreeing to the foregoing and representing 
and warranting that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which the United 
States has embargoed good or services or similar restrictions (e.g. the Crimea region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Sudan or Syria without an appropriate exemption), and you are not identified as a “Specially Designated National” or “Foreign
Sanctions Evader” by OFAC, you are not placed on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Denied Persons, Entity or Unverified List or
any similar lists, you are not an entity that a Specially Designated National owns in the aggregate a 50% or greater interest
in directly or indirectly, and you will not access or use the SDK if any applicable laws in your country prohibit you from
doing so in accordance with this Agreement or limit the terms of this Agreement.  You will not export the SDK or any modificat
ion or derivative work thereof to support any nuclear proliferation, chemical weapons, biological weapons or missile proliferation activity.

12. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  All software, technology, and accompanying documentation are deemed to be “commercial
computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR
Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, transfer or disclosure of
the SDK and accompanying documentation by any agency, department or other entity of any government, shall be governed solely by
the terms of this Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms herein or in a
writing signed by an authorized signatory on behalf of Nexmo Inc. No other rights are granted.

13. MISCELLANEOUS.  This Agreement contains the complete agreement between you and Nexmo regarding the SDK and supersedes all
prior agreements and representations between you and Nexmo regarding the SDK.  Nexmo reserves the right, in its sole 
discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time by posting a notice on this webpage, on its website located at 
www.nexmo.com or by sending you a notice through the Services, or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. 
This Agreement may only be amended and any provision may only be waived by a writing executed by both parties except as 
otherwise set forth above.  You agree to promptly provide Nexmo with all information and documentation that Nexmo requests to 
verify your compliance with this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it 
shall be reformed to the limited extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed 
in accordance with the laws of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.  California will have exclusive 
jurisdiction and venue under this Agreement.  You may not assign or transfer any part of this Agreement to any third party.  
Nexmo may assign and transfer this Agreement without consent to a successor to all or substantially all of its business or 
assets to which this Agreement relates.
